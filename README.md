# Google_Play_Store_Data

For this analysis, we are going to pretend that we're a tech startup that wants to launch a new app. Our company has several different options in the pipeline, and because we're a new company we want our app to have a large number of downloads in order to widely introduce our name and product. What factors do we need to consider in order to maximize downloads? For example, how much should we charge? Does the size of our app make a significant difference?

In order to answer these questions, this project analyzes data scraped from the Google Play Store in August 2018. 

From this initial look at Google Play Store app data, we can conclude that the app should cost less than \$3.00, and ideally be around 10-20Mb in order to maximize the number of downloads. Future updates to this analysis will explore how content rating and genre impact the number of downloads.
